# NYC Parking Violations Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive analysis** of **New York City parking violations** from **2014 to 2023**, focusing on borough-specific enforcement patterns, COVID-19 impacts, and financial consequences.  
It also introduces **machine learning** and **deep learning** models, including **neural networks**, to predict violation codes based on time, location, and vehicle features ‚Äî supporting **AI-driven urban management** and **resource allocation**.

A full **research paper** documenting methodology, experiments, results, and policy implications is included in this repository.
